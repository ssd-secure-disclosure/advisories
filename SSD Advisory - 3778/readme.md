**Vulnerabilities Summary**<br>
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) contains three vulnerabilities that when exploited allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve root privileges and execute code remotely. The first is a Stored Cross Site Scripting file upload vulnerability that allows the attacker to upload and execute html pages on victims browser. The second is an already known vulnerability Unsafe Flex AMF Java Object Deserialization CVE-2017-5641 which we used in this exploit. The third is a Privilege Escalation via Incorrect sudo File Permissions that let local attackers run code as root.

An independent security researcher, Pedro Ribeiro, has reported this vulnerability to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program.

**Affected systems**<br>
Cisco Identity Services Engine version 2.4.0

**Vulnerability Details**<br>
First Vulnerability: Stored Cross Site Scripting
Attack Vector: Remote

The LiveLogSettingsServlet, available at /admin/LiveLogSettingsServlet, contains a stored cross site scripting vulnerability. The doGet() HTTP request handler takes in an Action parameter as a HTTP query variable, which can be “read” or “write”.

With the “write” parameter, it calls the writeLiveLogSettings() function which then takes several query string variables, such as Columns, Rows, Refresh_rate and Time_period. The content of these query string variables is then written to /opt/CSCOcpm/mnt/dashboard/liveAuthProps.txt, and the server responds with a 200 OK.

These parameters are not validated, and can contain any text. When the Action parameter equals “read”, the servlet will read the /opt/CSCOcpm/mnt/dashboard/liveAuthProps.txt file and display it back to the user with the Content-Type “text/html”, causing whatever was written to that file to be rendered and executed by the browser. To mount a simple attack, we can send the following request:

```shell
GET /admin/LiveLogSettingsServlet?Action=write&Columns=1&Rows=%3c%73%63%72%69%70%74%3e%61%6c%65%72%74%28%31%29%3c%2f%73%63%72%69%70%74%3e&Refresh_rate=1337&Time_period=1337
```

Which can then be triggered with:

```shell
GET /admin/LiveLogSettingsServlet?Action=read HTTP/1.1
-----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 164
Server:
<Settings>
<Columns>
<Col>1</Col>
</Columns>
<Rows><script>alert(1)</script></Rows>
<Refresh_rate>1337</Refresh_rate>
<Time_period>1337</Time_period>
</Settings>
```

Second Vulnerability: Unsafe Flex AMF Java Object Deserialization
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Requires authentication to the admin web interface

By sending an HTTP POST request with random data to /admin/messagebroker/amfsecure, the server will respond with a 200 OK and binary data that includes:

```shell
...Unsupported AMF version XXXXX...
```

Which indicates that the server has a Apache / Adobe Flex AMF (BlazeDS) endpoint at that location. The BlazeDS library version running on the server is 4.0.0.14931, which means it is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5641 [2], the description of which is stated below: “Previous versions of Apache Flex BlazeDS (4.7.2 and earlier) did not restrict which types were allowed for AMF(X) object deserialization by default. During the deserialization process code is executed that for several known types has undesired side-effects. Other, unknown types may also exhibit such behaviors. One vector in the Java standard library exists that allows an attacker to trigger possibly further exploitable Java deserialization of untrusted data. Other known vectors in third party libraries can be used to trigger remote code execution.”

This vulnerability was previously exploited in DrayTek VigorACS by Agile Information Security, as it can be seen in [3] and [4]. Please refer to that advisory and exploit, as well as [5], [6] and [7] for further details on this vulnerability.

The the exploit chain works in the same way as the previous one:
a) sends an AMF binary payload to /admin/messagebroker/amfsecure as described in [6] to trigger a Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP) call back to the attacker

b) receives the JRMP connection with ysoserial’s JRMP listener [8]

c) calls ysoserial with the ROME payload, as a vulnerable version of Rome (1.0 RC2) is in the Java classpath of the server

d) execute ncat (the binary is on the ISE virtual appliance) and return a reverse shell running as the iseaminportal user

Second Vulnerability: Unsafe Flex AMF Java Object Deserialization
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Requires authentication to the admin web interface

By sending an HTTP POST request with random data to /admin/messagebroker/amfsecure, the server will respond with a 200 OK and binary data that includes:

d) execute ncat (the binary is on the ISE virtual appliance) and return a reverse shell running as the iseaminportal users

Third Vulnerability: Privilege Escalation via Incorrect sudo File Permissions
Attack Vector: Local
Constraints: Requires a command shell running as the iseadminportal user

The iseadminportal user can run a variety of commands as root via sudo (output of ‘sudo -l’):

```shell
(root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/resetMntDb.sh *
(root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/resetMnTSessDir.sh *

(root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/show_iowait.sh *
(root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/kerberosprobe.sh *
(root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/sxp-servercontrol.sh *
```

All of the files above are writeable by the iseadminportal user. This makes it trivial to perform privilege escalation to root. All that is needed to do is to edit the files, and add a “/bin/sh” to the second and / or last line, then run the script as sudo to get a root shell.

Exploit for Cisco Identify Services Engine (ISE), tested on version 2.4.0.357
CVE-TODO
By Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com) from Agile Information Security,
and Dominik Czarnota (dominik.b.czarnota@gmail.com)
This exploit starts by abusing a stored cross scripting to deploy malicious Javascript to /admin/LiveLogSettingsServlet.
The Javascript contains a binary payload that will cause a XHR request to the AMF endpoint on the ISE server, which is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5641 (Unsafe Java AMF deserialization), leading to remote code execution as the iseadminportal user.
This AMF deserialization can only be triggered by an authenticated user, hence why the stored XSS is necessary.
The exploit will wait until the server executes the AMF deserialization payload and spawn netcat to receive a reverse shell from the server.
Once we have code execution as the unprivileged iseadminportal user, we can edit various shell script files under /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/ and run them as sudo, escalating our privileges to root.
This exploit has only been tested in Linux. The two jars described below are required for execution of the exploit, and they should be in the same directory as this script.
